Question 1:
Computed summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for the ViolentCrimesPerPop variable and interpreted the distribution.

Question 2:
Created a histogram and boxplot of ViolentCrimesPerPop to visualize its distribution, spread, median, and potential outliers.

Question 3:
Split the kidney disease dataset into training and testing sets (70/30) to prepare the data for supervised machine learning.

Question 4:
Trained a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier (k=5) to predict chronic kidney disease and evaluated it using a confusion matrix and performance metrics.

Question 5:
Compared KNN models with different values of k (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) to analyze how model flexibility affects test accuracy and select the best-performing k.
